Description: The package reads a protein trajectory and analyses local 
  conformational transitions via a Structural Alphabet. The Mutual 
  Information (MI) between those transitions computed for all residue pairs 
  yields a MI matix, which forms the basis of subsequent analyses. MI matrices 
  of trajectory slices are diagonalised and the overlap between their 
  eigenspaces is computed.  Using the contrast between different substates, 
  the MI signal can be extracted directly via the subtraction of the 
  corresponding matrices. Residues with high MI signals are annotated as
  hub residues if their FDR is below a chosen threshold.
