#' 2-dimensional plot of the covariance overlap between continguous mutual information matrices, defined in the input trajectory.
#' 
#' This function generates a 2d plot of the diagonal of the smoothed covariance overlap matrix, generated by matrix_smooth().
#' The function saves a plot as *.pdf in the working directory.
#'  
#' 
#'
#' @param overlap.matrix.s Smoothed matrix of covariance overlaps, computed using matrix_smooth().
#' @param t.traj Length of the MD simulation, in nanoseconds.
#' @return A plot in *.pdf
#' @export
